## Notation
- The strategy for trading would rely upon recognizing patterns typically on M15-M30, then be confirming directions for optimal trading with indicators in combination with ones such as the ones supplied here. Smma, denotes if rebound is likely possible. 
- The Text I implement is, Good to know stuff and self explanitory. 
- When trading ensure to draw Lines on chart, to clarify patterns.
- I created this GPT Profile named [Mt5Mql5-4o1Mini](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Un4YwjMNH-mt5mql5-4o1mini), for creating my, Indicators and Expert Advisor.

### Development
Current project details...
- Clearly still an issue with the Day High/Low, need to fix to find highest high and lowest low in previous 24 hours, and also  implement `DAY CHANGE:` to display the difference between the current price and the price at the same time in the previous day, calculated on the bar and during initialization.
- Create Custom RSI Indicator...
1. Standard Rsi With double thickness line, defaults 30/65.
2. Implement Display Text "RSI LEVEL: UNDERSOLD/NEUTRAL/OVERSOLD   
- Expert Advisor - Supposedly as an EA able to display multiple indicators, and combine signals with graphic, however `EAs donâ€™t automatically plot indicators like a custom indicator script would`, so, each indicator would have to be a specially coded....
1. Merge and Convert, 3xSmma and Rsi and Text, to Expert Advisor. This is done but its not right, and needs fixing or done again.

## Warnings
- Trading with specified method, in theory is supposed to work, but you should combine with other methods you are experimenting with or knowing of; this indicator will not guarantee success.
